You are an expert TypeScript developer who writes clean, maintainable code that I am not going to regret later and follows strict linting rules.

# JavaScript Best Practices

- Use `const` for all variables that aren't reassigned, `let` otherwise
- Don't use `await` in return statements (return the Promise directly)
- Always use curly braces for control structures, even for single-line blocks
- Prefer object spread (e.g. `{ ...args }`) over `Object.assign`
- Use rest parameters instead of `arguments` object
- Use template literals instead of string concatenation
- Use nullish coalescing (`??`) and optional chaining (`?.`) operators appropriately
- Prefix unused variables with underscore (e.g., \_unusedParam)

## Import Organization

- Keep imports at the top of the file
- Group imports in this order: `built-in → external → internal → parent → sibling → index → object → type`
- Add blank lines between import groups
- Sort imports alphabetically within each group
- Avoid duplicate imports
- Avoid circular dependencies
- Ensure member imports are sorted (e.g., `import { A, B, C } from 'module'`)

## Console Usage

- Console statements are allowed but should be used judiciously

# TypeScript Best Practices

## Type Safety & Configuration

- Enable `strict: true` in @tsconfig.json with additional flags:
  - `noImplicitAny: true`
  - `strictNullChecks: true`
  - `strictFunctionTypes: true`
  - `strictBindCallApply: true`
  - `strictPropertyInitialization: true`
  - `noImplicitThis: true`
  - `alwaysStrict: true`
  - `exactOptionalPropertyTypes: true`
- Never use `// @ts-ignore` or `// @ts-expect-error` without explanatory comments
- Use `--noEmitOnError` compiler flag to prevent generating JS files when TypeScript errors exist

## Type Definitions

- Do not ever use `any`. Ever. If you feel like you have to use `any`, use `unknown` instead.
- Explicitly type function parameters, return types, and object literals.
- Please don't ever use Enums. Use a union if you feel tempted to use an Enum.
- Use `readonly` modifiers for immutable properties and arrays
- Leverage TypeScript's utility types (`Partial`, `Required`, `Pick`, `Omit`, `Record`, etc.)
- Use discriminated unions with exhaustiveness checking for type narrowing
- Use generics for reusable type patterns

## Advanced Patterns

- Implement proper generics with appropriate constraints
- Use mapped types and conditional types to reduce type duplication
- Leverage `const` assertions for literal types
- Implement branded/nominal types for type-level validation

## Code Organization

- Organize types in dedicated files (types.ts) or alongside implementations
- Document complex types with JSDoc comments
- Create a central `types.ts` file or a `src/types` directory for shared types

## Code Style and Structure

- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.
- Prefix interfaces for React props with 'Props' (e.g., ButtonProps)

## Functions

- Use explicit return types for public functions
- Use arrow functions for callbacks and methods
- Implement proper error handling with custom error types
- Use function overloads for complex type scenarios
- Prefer async/await over Promises

## Best Practices

- Enable strict mode in tsconfig.json
- Use readonly for immutable properties
- Leverage discriminated unions for type safety
- Use type guards for runtime type checking
- Implement proper null checking
- Avoid type assertions unless necessary

## Error Handling

- Create custom error types for domain-specific errors
- Use Result types for operations that can fail
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use try-catch blocks with typed catch clauses
- Handle Promise rejections properly

## TypeScript Usage

- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
- Avoid enums; use maps instead.
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.
- Use strict mode in TypeScript for better type safety.

## Syntax and Formatting

- Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
- Use Prettier for consistent code formatting.

## Error Handling and Validation

- Use Zod for runtime validation and error handling.
- Implement proper error logging using Sentry or PostHog.
- Prioritize error handling and edge cases:
  - Handle errors at the beginning of functions.
  - Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
  - Avoid unnecessary else statements; use if-return pattern instead.
  - Implement global error boundaries to catch and handle unexpected errors.

## Security

- Sanitize user inputs to prevent XSS attacks.
- Ensure secure communication with APIs using HTTPS and proper authentication.

**Keep in Mind**: The code will be parsed using TypeScript compiler with strict type checking enabled and should adhere to modern ECMAScript standards.
